Business Use Cases of the U2Demo project - Task 1.4

This repository is the output of the work conducted in Task T1.4 and gives the Business Use Cases (BUCs) identified for the demo sites participating in the U2Demo project. These BUCs address the current operation of the Energy Communities (ECs), as well as the future operation of the ECs including additional flexible assets, additional flexibility markets and different market model structures. As the infrastructure and the needs of the demo sites vary significantly, the BUCs are modelled pilot-specific, but can be easily applied to ECs with similar structures. 

The BUCs are modelled in Sparx Enterprise Architect® software with the Modsarus® plugin, according to the Use Case methodology in IEC 62559-2:2015. In addition to the Enterprise Architect files, Word files and .xml files are provided for each BUC, to easily access the BUCs and to facilitate integration into other software.
